# Effective Collaborative Paper Writing 


# Presenter Notes
Thank you everyone for coming. We all have big workloads and I really appreciate you picking out this session and giving me your attention for an hour. I really hope you get a lot out of it.

# Housekeeping

* You can view this presentation at http://joereddington.com/slides/cm2019/

* Who Have I got? (show of hands)  

# Presenter Notes
Let's start with housekeeping, if you have trouble seeing the slides in this room you can bring them up on your own devices with that link. Handy if you want to quickly go back or indeed, skip to the end.

# Ego slide

* Dr Joseph Redington @joereddington
* Computer Scientist
* eQuality Time, charity set up in 2014, major project is White Water Writers. 
--- 

# Goals for Talk
* To give you a set of processes and principles that you can use and thus... 
* To save you at least an hour of pain next time you write a paper with other people and thus: 
* More papers written, faster, frontiers of science pushed back. 
* Nobody stays if they aren't enjoying themselves. 

--- 

# Contents

* Where I come from. 
* The problems to solve. 

* The research. 
* The first email. 
* Roles, times, and tools. 
  * Reviewers 
* Process.   
  * Specification 
  * Design 
  * Drafting 
  * Submission. 


---
# The research 

...You should probably do the work first.  

---

# The first email. 


This is bad: 

> Yo, you guys want to write a paper about our work with me? We'd probably send it to one of the journals in psychology? 


The person who wrote this hasn't bothered to solve any of the hard problems.

--- 

# Paper drama 
* Four people expecting to do 25% of the work. 
* Nobody wants to write the first draft.  
* Where is it going?  When? 
* I did the last version
* Author order. 
* Waiting for Important Professor to look at it. 

# Result 
* Paper dies quietly in three inboxes. 

--- 

Most of these problems can be solved in the first email. Let's change one thing.  

> Yo, you guys want to write a paper about our work for IEEE Transactions on Transactional Analysis of Banking Transactions? The next deadline is 3rd of March, which gives us three weeks.    

--- 

We can do better: 

> Yo, you guys want to write a paper about our work for IEEE Transactions on Transactional Analysis of Banking Transactions? The next deadline is 3rd of March, which gives us three weeks.  If we miss that deadline I'd like to send it to the International Conference on Banking Transations, which has a deadline of 10th March.  If ITTABT rejects it, then we'd have two weeks to revise before we could send it to the National Conference on Banking Transactions on 19th October.  


The author of this version has done some work. Deadlines have been established. Failsafes built in. I'm confident this won't die in a drawer. 

--- 

Let's head off another issue: 

> ... rejects it, then we'd have two weeks to revise before we could send it to the National Conference on Banking Transactions on 19th October.  
> I'm proposing an author list of Banner, Strange, Octavius. 


We'd like to pretend this is never an issue and yet we've all dealt with it. 

--- 

# Roles 

To stop your paper dying you need to know who is in which group: 

* The paper authors. 
* The people who actually write the paper 
* The reviewers 
* The vetoing reviewers. 

'Vetoing reviewers' can be a subset of authors cannot intersect with writers or reviewers.  Writers and reviewers also can't intersect. Writers is a subset of Authors.  

TODO - venn diagram 


I'll talk about how to manage each of these groups 

--- 


# Roles of Writers. 

* Every person in the group should have a role. Why did you invite them? What do they bring? 
 
> I see our contributions as my take on international Banking, Strange's wider view on interdimensional banking and Banner's expertise in transactional analysis. 

* There are necessary roles as well. 
    * Destination
    * Diagrams/LaTeX 
    * Experiments

> I'm happy to handle managing all the submission prep if Banner can be our code expert.

# What problems do we have left? 

Here's a selection: 
* Four people expecting to do 25% of the work. 
* Nobody wants to write the first draft.  
* I did the last version

How do I solve that in fiction? Everybody in the room at the same time. 

---

# The room where it happens. 

* Can be a zoom room. 
* Need a collaborative writing platform (drive, dropbox, etherpad, overleaf, idc) 
* You all give equal time. 
* Never a time when you don't have stuff to do. 

> Looking at the submission guidelines, I think we probably need three three hour sprints to really crush this. If everybody is in, then I'll send a Doddle poll out. 

--- 

# Reviewers 

> Hi Tony,  I'm looking for a favour. I've got a writing sprint coming up on the 5th June and I need a proofread before the next one on the 7th, would you be able to help? 

Then... 

> Thanks so much! The link to the group folder is [here](some link) and it's yours from 2pm. 

You will need: 

* Structural reviewer (Selected by the author with the destination role) 
  * Ideally your structural reviewer would give feedback at the start of the next sprint. 
* Prose reviewer 
* Several proofreaders. 

## Long-term review network
* If Reviewer 2 is pointing out things that your internal review network didn't find, then you need to upgrade your internal review network. 

--- 

# Why a structural reviewer? 

Because the first thing you need is a structure. 

* Produce a set of bullet points for your paper. Review and revise until you agree. Then produce more. 

* Keep Adding bullet points until you have one per paragraph that you expect in the final paper. 
* Other people (your structural reviewer) should be able to read the bullet points and understand (if NOT believe) your paper. 

---
# Veto Reviewer

* If you are one, you should drive the paper. 
* Keep them in the loop. 
* Build evidence of approval 
* Be clear how hard you are working. 
* Arrange to present (NOT email) to them after every sprint. 

--- 

# What we know so far. 
* Start with a very long email. 
* Everybody in the same room at the same time.  
* Strong internal review network  
* Structure first. 

--- 

# Revisiting the problems from the start 
* Four people expecting to do 25% of the work. 
* Nobody wants to write the first draft.  
* Where is it going?  When? 
* I did the last version
* Author order. 
* Waiting for Important Professor to look at it.

# The Open Voice Factory
* We think AAC should be completely free
* We recognise that cost comes in different forms 

When we founded eQuality Time, we wanted to make open and free AAC software a key part of what we do.  

* Step one was producing [CommuniKate](http://communikate.equalitytime.co.uk/), the open access pageset
* Step two was the Open Voice Factory.

# How the Open Voice Factory works
* The Open Voice Factory is about free AAC 
* [Fully live site](http://www.theopenvoicefactory.org/)
* For all the missing people 
* Edit by PowerPoint. 
* Uses the Open Board format 
* Entirely Open Source 
* It has failed. 

# Presenter Notes
This presentation isn't strictly speaking about the Open Voice Factory, but you need to know a bit about it to go forwards  

18,000 people in the UK would benefit from powered AAC but don't have access. Cost is understood to be one of the big barriers. And it's not just that the system costs a grand it's the time and the energy of the appointments to be assessed for funding.  

So we started the Open Voice Factory - which is an entirely free AAC device. If you go to the website you can click the link and use the default version. 

If you want to edit it, that's cool, we actually use Powerpoint as the editing device, you download the file, make changes to it, and then upload it again.  The Open Voice Factory will give you a unique link that is to the aid you just created.   

It uses the Open Board format so it's entirely compatible with things like CoughDrop and Optikey. 

This was how I was going to change the world, and it's failed. People aren't using it and I don't know why.  I wish I did, I and lots of other people have poured our hearts into it and it's not getting used. So if anyone has an idea, then I am all ears. 

I'm going to keep running it, almost entirely out of stubboness, but that's actually the subject of this talk. And I should move on.

# Comic Relief 

We are ridiculously grateful to Comic Relief; both the funding at the way they awarded it. 

* Where we were beforehand
* Simply entry: video and single page
* Video is at: 
* Fund wasn't actually for us. 
* Tech person in interview
* shortlist meant it was 50-50.
* Serious group - Samaritans, Oxfam 
* Didn't need a plan 

# Presenter Notes
So the reason for the talk is that Comic Relief gave us £45,000 to work on the Open Voice Factory and it would be good to tell people what we did with it. There are things I'm proud of and things I'm ashamed of. 

Lots of things happened and I've tried to pick out the things that I think you would be interested in. The rest of the talk is roughly divided between those things however, I'm going to be lead by you. If you look bored I'm going to move on, if you look interested I'll spend a bit more time with it. If I skip your favourite bit then come see me afterwards I'll talk about it personally.  

So, watching your faces carefully... I'm going to talk about how to get comic relief to give you £45,000, which I think will be useful because some of you have similar projects. Okay, 

I'm going to talk about the overall project plan, what we wanted to do and how we wanted to do it. 

I'm going to talk about medical device registration, hopefully in an interesting way, and if any of you are event thinking about developing any tools or resources then you'll need to hear that.  

I'm going to talk about Fraud, it's not particularly AAC related, but it happened to us, it wasn't very nice and we got hurt. And if you are ever going to pay a programmer you might want to know about it.  

--- 
# Act 2: The problems to solve and building a team.  

--- 

# Problems 
* People didn't know much about it. 
* We might be doing it wrong. 
* Medical device registration: like parking a aircraft carrier


# Plan 
* Find a cohort and interview them
  * Pass the feedback to the coders 
  * Ask them again 

If we go around that loop enought then we'll be sure. 

Bonus. 

Ask serious and important people. 'Alpha Pup strategy'   

Meanwhile - spend money on Medical Device Registration. Get a consultant, do the business 

--- 


# Building a team. 

* Me. 
* Pageset Designer
* Documentation Writer.  
* Coders 
* Medical Device Consultant 

Everyone given/told about their first jobs

# Presenter Notes

If you haven't ever managed a project should you probably know that 90% of your budget is staff. Everything else is just noise.  Staff is everything. 


--- 
# Getting started 

* Gathered our people. Some where easier than others: 
	* Lee Ridley 
	* RCSLT/CM
	* Academics 
	* Users
        * NCOs
* Customer is always right 
* Created a big set of issues to deal with. 
  * Some for me, some for programmers, some for designers 

Lots of good content lots of things changed.  


--- 
# Medical Device Registration 

* Restructure the whole organisation
* Very clear written processes in place for everything. 
* The actual submission isn't about the device, it's a set of evidence. 
* Need to comply with a range of ISOs, which you have to pay for
* Literally never been done with an open source device. 

--- 
# Rocks fall 

* Fraud
* Caused by lack of capacity 

--- 
# Act 3: Medical Device Registration and new system 

* More consultants 
* More paperwork
* Hero volunteers 
* Snotty Crying

--- 
# Conclusions

* We aren't going to stop. 
  * Open source will come and we are putting cracks in the wall
* We remain a serious bit of the puzzle. 
* I'm in the mood for something big and bold 

--- 

# Goals for Talk
* Everybody is aware of the risks of launching a new project  
* Everybody understands why open projects are resilient to this. 
* Everyone gets a healthy respect of Medical Device Registration.
* Someone might tell me what I'm doing wrong. 
* Nobody stays if they aren't enjoying themselves.
