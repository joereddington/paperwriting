# Effective Collaborative Paper Writing 


# Presenter Notes
Thank you everyone for coming. We all have big workloads and I really appreciate you picking out this session and giving me your attention for an hour. I really hope you get a lot out of it.

# Housekeeping

* Who Have I got? (show of hands)  

# Presenter Notes
Let's start with housekeeping, if you have trouble seeing the slides in this room you can bring them up on your own devices with that link. Handy if you want to quickly go back or indeed, skip to the end.

# Ego slide

* Dr Joseph Redington @joereddington
* Computer Scientist
* eQuality Time, charity set up in 2014, major project is White Water Writers. 
--- 

# Goals for Talk
* To give you a set of processes and principles that you can use and thus... 
* To save you at least an hour of pain next time you write a paper with other people and thus: 
* More papers written, faster, frontiers of science pushed back. 
* Nobody stays if they aren't enjoying themselves.

# Contents

* Where I come from. 
* The problems to solve. 

* The research. 
* The first email. 
* Roles, times, and tools. 
  * Reviewers 
* Process.   
  * Specification 
  * Design 
  * Drafting 
  * Submission.

# The research 

...You should probably do the work first.  

---

# The first email. 


This is bad: 

> Yo, you guys want to write a paper about our work with me? We'd probably send it to one of the journals in psychology? 


The person who wrote this hasn't bothered to solve any of the hard problems.

--- 

# Paper drama 
* Four people expecting to do 25% of the work. 
* Nobody wants to write the first draft.  
* Where is it going?  When? 
* I did the last version
* Author order. 
* Waiting for Important Professor to look at it. 

# Result 
* Paper dies quietly in three inboxes. 

--- 

Most of these problems can be solved in the first email. Let's change one thing.  

> Yo, you guys want to write a paper about our work for IEEE Transactions on Transactional Analysis of Banking Transactions? The next deadline is 3rd of March, which gives us three weeks.    

--- 

We can do better: 

> Yo, you guys want to write a paper about our work for IEEE Transactions on Transactional Analysis of Banking Transactions? The next deadline is 3rd of March, which gives us three weeks.  If we miss that deadline I'd like to send it to the International Conference on Banking Transations, which has a deadline of 10th March.  If ITTABT rejects it, then we'd have two weeks to revise before we could send it to the National Conference on Banking Transactions on 19th October.  


The author of this version has done some work. Deadlines have been established. Failsafes built in. I'm confident this won't die in a drawer. 

--- 

Let's head off another issue: 

> ... rejects it, then we'd have two weeks to revise before we could send it to the National Conference on Banking Transactions on 19th October.  
> I'm proposing an author list of Walters, Williams, van Dyne. 


We'd like to pretend this is never an issue and yet we've all dealt with it. 

--- 

# Roles 

To stop your paper dying you need to know who is in which group: 

* The paper authors. 
* The people who actually write the paper 
* The reviewers 
* The vetoing reviewers. 

'Vetoing reviewers' can be a subset of Authors but cannot intersect with writers or reviewers.  Writers and reviewers also can't intersect. Writers is a subset of Authors.  

TODO - venn diagram 


I'll talk about how to manage each of these groups 

--- 


# Roles of Writers. 

* Every person in the group should have a role. Why did you invite them? What do they bring? 
 
> I see our contributions as my take on international Banking, Williams' wider view on interdimensional banking and Walters' expertise in transactional analysis. 

* There are necessary roles as well. 
    * Destination
    * Diagrams/LaTeX 
    * Experiments

> I'm happy to handle managing all the submission prep if Banner can be our code expert.

# What problems do we have left? 

Here's a selection: 
* Four people expecting to do 25% of the work. 
* Nobody wants to write the first draft.  
* I did the last version

How do I solve that in fiction? Everybody in the room at the same time. 

---

# The room where it happens. 

* This is a sprint
* Can be a zoom room. 
* Need a collaborative writing platform (drive, dropbox, etherpad, overleaf, idc) 
* You all give equal time. 
* Never a time when you don't have stuff to do. 
* They are fun, but they are still work and you need a few of them


> Looking at the submission guidelines, I think we probably need three three hour sprints to really crush this. If everybody is in, then I'll send a Doddle poll out. 

--- 

# Reviewers 

> Hi Tony,  I'm looking for a favour. I've got a writing sprint coming up on the 5th June and I need a proofread before the next one on the 7th, would you be able to help? 

Then... 

> Thanks so much! The link to the group folder is [here](some link) and it's yours from 2pm. 

You will need: 

* Structural reviewer (Selected by the author with the destination role) 
  * Ideally your structural reviewer would give feedback at the start of the next sprint. 
* Prose reviewer 
* Several proofreaders. 

## Long-term review network
* If Reviewer 2 is pointing out things that your internal review network didn't find, then you need to upgrade your internal review network. 

--- 

# Why a structural reviewer? 

Because the first thing you need is a structure. 

* Produce a set of bullet points for your paper. Review and revise until you agree. Then produce more. 

* Keep adding bullet points until you have one per paragraph that you expect in the final paper. 
* Other people (your structural reviewer) should be able to read the bullet points and understand (if not believe) your paper. 
* You will want to jump around when bulleting. That's cool, that's the point
* People remove your great ideas. 

---
# Veto Reviewer

* If you are one, you should drive the paper. 
* Keep them in the loop. 
* Build evidence of approval 
* Be clear how hard you are working. 
* Arrange to present (NOT email) to them after every sprint. 

--- 

# What we know so far. 
* Start with a very long email. 
* Everybody in the same room at the same time.  
* Strong internal review network  
* Structure first. 

--- 

# Revisiting the problems from the start 
* Four people expecting to do 25% of the work. 
* Nobody wants to write the first draft.  
* Where is it going?  When? 
* I did the last version
* Author order. 
* Waiting for Important Professor to look at it.
